MergeFiles is a Windows application that allows you to merge multiple files or entire folders into a single text file. It's especially handy for developers who want to collect project files in one place, share code snippets, or prepare data for AI tools.

## Versions

| Version | Framework | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **MergeFilesWPF** | .NET 10.0 (LTS) | Modern dark theme UI with animations |
| **MergeFilesWinForms** | .NET 9.0 | Classic Windows Forms UI |

## Features

- **Drag & Drop support**: Drop files or folders directly into the window
- **Add folder with subfolders**: Automatically includes all files in a directory tree
- **File extension filter (allow.txt)**: Control which file types are included
- **Ignore list (ignore.txt)**: Exclude unwanted folders (e.g., `bin`, `obj`, `build`, `node_modules`)
- **Include override (include.txt)**: Force include specific files from ignored folders
- **Automatic AI header**: Merged files include automatic header with file list for AI tools
- **Easy management**: Remove selected items, clear the entire list, and see the total file count
- **File merging**: Combines the contents of all selected files into a single output file
- **Encoding detection**: Supports UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 with BOM detection
- **Quick access**: Opens the merged file's folder automatically after saving
- **Configurable**: Directly open and edit config files from the UI

## Configuration Files

## Merged File Format

The merged output file includes an automatic header for AI context:
```
===== MERGED FILE INFO =====

This file contains the merged contents of multiple source files.
Each file's content is separated by a header showing the file name.

Total files: 5
